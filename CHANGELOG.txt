v.4.2.0

- 1.19 release.* 
- Mob spawn configs are dead, this is due to changes with Forge itself. All mob spawn locations and min/max/weight options are now changable via datapacks. The location of the datapacks are currently data/forge/biome_modifier
	- Bosses such as Icon of Sin, Motherdemon, Arch Maykr and the Gladiator do not have entries as they spawn naturally with their structures. 
- REI support is disabled until REI Forge is released.
- Fixes log spawn with Nether Church, Icon of Sin Fight Arena and Gladiator arena. 	

* Currently loading a world with world generation datapacks requires a work around to get working. 
	- When creating the world, simply select Datapacks and unload any random datapack such as Geckolibs.
	- Simply reload the datapack now
	- Save and it will properly load all datapacks, allowing you to create the world as normal and generate all stuctures and mob spawns.
